Heya! I'm MeYwO, but you can call me Ruby.

Dice Roller is an app/website that lets anyone roll custom dice, basically the app allows the user to customize their die by adding sides, modifying values,
and then rolling their custom die.

The idea for this project came from wanting to easily use cursed dice in my DND sessions.

Thanks for reading :D
